name=Spectral Spatialisation
description=Spatialisation using a Laplacian matrix on a signed graph. See Kunegis et al., "Spectral Analysis of Signed Graphs for Clustering, Prediction and Visualization", 2010 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining.

SpectralSpatialisation.weight_attribute.name = Weight attribute
SpectralSpatialisation.weight_attribute.desc = The attribute of edges to use as weight. Boolean and numeric are directly converted to double. Anything else is considered 1.0.

SpectralSpatialisation.weight_ignore.name = Ignore weight
SpectralSpatialisation.weight_ignore.desc = Consider all weight to 1.0 ?

SpectralSpatialisation.sign_attribute.name = Sign attribute
SpectralSpatialisation.sign_attribute.desc = The attribute of edges to use as sign. False and non-zero negative numeric values are considered negative. Anything else is considered positive.

SpectralSpatialisation.sign_ignore.name = Ignore sign
SpectralSpatialisation.sign_ignore.desc = Consider all signs to be positive ?

SpectralSpatialisation.scale.name = Scale of the graph
SpectralSpatialisation.scale.desc = Stretch up the graph in both directions (The graph is initally condensed)

SpectralSpatialisation.thirdComponent.name = Third component
SpectralSpatialisation.thirdComponent.desc = Impact of third component on horizontal position. As the computation may result in too many nodes being vertically aligned, this can help to scater them a little more horizontally.

SpectralSpatialisation.fourthComponent.name = Fourth component
SpectralSpatialisation.fourthComponent.desc = Impact of fourth component on vetical position.
